    "Using Football-API, I'll be pulling data about team statistics to create a Tableau dashboard comparing two teams' season statistics. Since I'm starting on the free plan, only team statistics from the 2021, 2022, and 2023 seasons can be pulled. The purpose for this notebook is using the API to pull data and transform it into a pandas dataframe to be exported for Tableau use (in a xlsx file or csv file to be determined in the future). "
